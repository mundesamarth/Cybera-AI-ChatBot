## 1:27:00 Creating BackEnd Server

Initialise Node Application: `npm init -y`
we will be running express server in the index.js in the Backend folder, we will add "start":"node index.js" in the package.json file and in the terminal we use npm start to start. But everytime we make changes in the index.js file, we have to run `npm start` so we will install "nodemon" `npm i nodemon` and inside package.json its gonna be `nodemon index.js`.

### next we will install express server
`npm i express`
